The '📁 BayesianNetworks/' directory contains code for building Bayesian networks:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - '📄Read_data.py': Reads data from speech samples and saves the extracted codewords into CSV files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - '📄main.py': Loads codewords from the CSV files, constructs the Bayesian networks, and saves the resulting network structures as images.

Will be further updated in the near future.
